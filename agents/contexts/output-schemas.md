# Agent Output Schemas

Every agent MUST self-validate its output against the schema below before returning.
This is the contract between agents — a violation blocks the workflow.

## Universal Requirements (all agents)

Every agent output MUST include:
- `## Confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW` at the end
- Explicit reference to which output file(s) were created (full paths)
- No unexplained TODO/FIXME markers in the produced artifact

If any requirement is missing, the output is invalid — re-generate before returning.

5. `## API Contract` — only if story has endpoints
6. `## Files to Create/Modify` — table with File / Action / Description

9. `## Confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW`

**Validation checks:**
- At least 3 acceptance criteria per story

## test-engineer — TEST_PLANNING mode (Phase 2.5)

**Output file:** `sie_v2/docs/process/test-plans/TEST-PLAN-{ticket}.md`

3. `## Testability Constraints` — numbered list
4. `## Test Cases` — table with #/Story/Function/Test Case/Type/Category
5. `## Fixtures` — table with Fixture/Source/Purpose
6. `## Testability Risks` — table with Risk/Story/Impact/Mitigation
7. `## Estimated Test Count: N`
8. `## Files to Create`
9. `## Confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW`

**Validation checks:**
- Every story's AC has at least one test case row
- Every public function mentioned has 3+ test cases (happy + error + edge)
- All fixtures either exist in conftest.py or marked as "create new"

## architect-reviewer (Phase 3)

**Output file:** review report (returned as agent response, not a file)

**Required sections:**

1. `# Architecture Review - Stories + Test Plan`
2. `**Verdict:** APPROVED / APPROVED_WITH_MINOR / CHANGES_REQUIRED`
3. `## Summary` — 2-3 sentences
4. `## Findings` — table with # / Severity / Artifact / Description / Fix
5. `## Approved Stories` — list
6. `## Stories Requiring Changes` — list
7. `## Schema Freeze Status` — checklist
8. `## Confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW`

**Also produces:** `sie_v2/docs/process/schemas/SCHEMA-FROZEN-{ticket}.md` if verdict is APPROVED.

**Validation checks:**
- Findings table has columns: #, Severity, Artifact, Description, Fix
- Every BLOCKER has a concrete Fix column value
- Severity is one of: BLOCKER / IMPORTANT / MINOR / SUGGESTION / PRAISE

## backend-developer (Phase 4)

**Output:** modified/created source files + a completion report.

**Completion report structure:**

1. `## Files Created` — list
2. `## Files Modified` — list with brief description
3. `## Test Status` — `ruff check` result, `make test` result
4. `## Stories Implemented` — checkmark list
5. `## Confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW`

**Validation checks:**
- `ruff check .` MUST pass (no errors)
- `make test` MUST pass (no failing tests)
- Every story from the input has a corresponding checkmark

## test-engineer — TEST_WRITING mode (Phase 6)

**Validation report structure:**

1. `## Test Files Created` — list of paths
2. `## Coverage vs Plan` — matches test plan from Phase 2.5? Yes/No + diff
3. `## Test Execution` — `make test` output summary
4. `## Ruff Check` — pass/fail
5. `## Confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW`

**Validation checks:**
- Every test case from TEST-PLAN-{ticket}.md has a corresponding test method
- All imports at module top (no imports inside methods)
- All test names follow `test_should_{action}_when_{condition}` pattern

**Validation checks:**
- Every patch in section 6 has: file path + exact text to add + insertion point
- Telemetry table has all agents invoked during the cycle
- Every finding has a severity and a preventability rating

## Self-Validation Protocol

Before an agent returns its output, it MUST:

1. Read its section in this file
2. Check every required section is present
3. Check the output file is at the correct path (if applicable)
4. Check the Confidence line is present
5. If ANY check fails → re-generate the missing parts before returning

**If self-validation fails twice**, return an explicit `VALIDATION_FAILED` marker
with the specific missing sections. The orchestrator will ask the user how to
proceed rather than silently passing invalid output downstream.
