# Verify Output

Before returning your output to the orchestrator, execute this self-validation protocol.

## Input

Your produced output (file path + content, or response text).

## Steps

### 1. Load your schema

Read `.claude/agents/contexts/output-schemas.md` and find your agent's section.

### 2. Check required sections

For each required section in your schema:
- Is the section header present (correct H2/H3 level)?
- Is the content non-empty?
- Does it match the expected format (table columns, list format)?

### 3. Check universal requirements

- [ ] `## Confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW` line is present at the end
- [ ] File paths mentioned use absolute paths from repo root
- [ ] No unexplained TODO/FIXME/XXX markers

### 4. Check output location

If your output is a file:
- [ ] File path matches the pattern specified in the schema
- [ ] File was actually written (not just returned in response)
- [ ] File is in the correct directory (`docs/process/...`)

### 5. Apply validation checks

Each agent has specific validation checks listed in its schema section.
Run through them explicitly.

### 6. Handle failures

**If any check fails:**

- First failure: silently fix and re-validate
- Second failure: return with explicit `VALIDATION_FAILED` marker:
  ```
  ## Self-Validation Failed
  
  Missing/malformed sections:
  - {section name}: {what's wrong}
  
  Please review before passing downstream.
  ```

**If all checks pass:** proceed to return output normally.

## Rules

1. **This skill is invoked implicitly by every agent at end of phase** — not by the user
2. **Never skip validation** — the cost of a malformed output downstream is higher than the cost of re-generating
3. **Do not change severity vocabulary** — stick to: BLOCKER / IMPORTANT / MINOR / SUGGESTION / PRAISE
4. **Confidence is mandatory** — if you can't honestly assess confidence, default to MEDIUM and explain why in the output
