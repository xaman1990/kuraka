# Kuraka — Development Orchestrator

> *Kuraka* (also "curaca") — from Quechua `kuraq` = "the elder". The
> local leader who coordinated the *ayllus* (specialist groups) under a
> larger plan. In this system, the Kuraka is the orchestrator that
> drives specialist agents through the phases of the development cycle.

This skill defines the **main flow**. Two companion files complement it:

- `kuraka-modes.md` — flow variants (Bootstrap, Brownfield, Standard,
  Compliance, Reduced-by-risk, Lite, Retroactive) and when to use each.
- `kuraka-policies.md` — cross-cutting policies (retry, timeout,
  telemetry, checkpoints).

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting you need:

1. A requirement document (REQ) or ticket reference.
2. A description of the requirement (from the ticket, markdown, or user
   input).

Also required: `kuraka.config.yaml` at the project root. If missing, ask
the user to run `kuraka init` (or copy the template from the framework's
`kuraka-artifacts/config-schema.yaml`).

If the user hasn't provided a requirement, ask before proceeding.

## Initial decision: mode and pipeline

**BEFORE invoking any agent**, evaluate the surface of the change and
decide:

1. **Which layers does it touch?** UI-only / types-only / service /
   repository / schema / integration / auth.
2. **How many files and estimated LOC?**
3. **Is there new logic? Contract change? PII / security? Migration?**

With that, pick a mode:

| Mode | Phases | When |
|------|:------:|------|
| **Normal** (default) | 8 | Changes with logic, DB, API contracts, or integrations |
| **Reduced by risk** | 3–5 | UI-only, types-only, mechanical renames — see `kuraka-modes.md` and `rules/17-kuraka-token-optimizations.md` |
| **Lite** | 3 | Trivial changes meeting 9 strict criteria — see `kuraka-modes.md` |
| **Retroactive** | 4 | Code already implemented without workflow (anti-pattern, avoid it) |

**Default is Normal.** Justify and present the proposed pipeline to the
user **before** invoking any agent — they approve which phases to run.

## Phase-Agent-Skill Map (Normal mode — 8 phases)

| Phase | Agent | Skill | Gate |
|-------|-------|-------|------|
| 1. PO Analysis | `po-analyst` | `analyze-requirement` | User approves REQ |
| 2. Story Refinement | `story-refiner` | `refine-stories` | User approves stories |
| 2.5. Test Planning | `test-engineer` (mode: TEST_PLANNING) | `plan-tests` | User approves test plan |
| 3. Architect Review | `architect-reviewer` | `review-stories` + `schema-freeze` | No BLOCKERS; schema frozen |
| 4a. Backend Impl | `backend-developer` | `implement-story` | `${stack.backend.lint_cmd}` + `${stack.backend.test_cmd}` OK |
| 4b. Frontend Impl | `frontend-developer` | `implement-story` | `${stack.frontend.lint_cmd}` + `${stack.frontend.typecheck_cmd}` + `${stack.frontend.test_cmd}` OK |
| 5. Code Review | `code-reviewer` | `review-implementation` | No BLOCKER or IMPORTANT |
| 5.5. Security Review | `security-reviewer` | `security-audit` | No CRITICAL |

| 6.5. E2E | `e2e-tester` | `generate-e2e-tests` | Playwright passes |
| 6.7. Deployment | `deployment-verifier` | `verify-deployment` | Docker / env / nginx / CI valid |
| 6.8. Smoke test runtime | orchestrator (with user approval) | (custom per cycle) | Smoke doc created or skip justified |
| 7. Final Audit | `final-auditor` | `run-audit` | Retro created |

### Conditional agents

| Phase | Agent | Condition |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 5 (sub) | `migration-reviewer` | Only if there are files in `${architecture.paths.migrations_root}` |

---

## Phases

### Phase 1 — PO Analysis
- Agent: `po-analyst` | Skill: `analyze-requirement`
- Output: `${architecture.paths.docs_process_root}/REQ-{YYYYMMDD}-{ticket}-{slug}.md`
- Content: scope IN/OUT, tables, endpoints, dependencies, risks, proposed stories.
- Gate: user approves REQ.

### Phase 2 — Story Refinement
- Agent: `story-refiner` | Skill: `refine-stories`
- Output: `${architecture.paths.docs_process_root}/stories/{ticket}-S{N}.md` (one per story).
- Content: description, verifiable AC, schema changes (if any), API contract, files.
- Rules: every identifier in `conventions.naming_language`; `conventions.null_syntax`; file paths from the stack profile; tenant scoping if `conventions.multi_tenant: true`.
- Gate: user approves stories.

### Phase 2.5 — Test Planning
- Agent: `test-engineer` (mode TEST_PLANNING) | Skill: `plan-tests`
- Output: `${architecture.paths.docs_process_root}/test-plans/TEST-PLAN-{ticket}.md`
- Content: testability constraints, test cases per story, fixtures, risks, estimated test count.
- Why: contract for the developer — the code must be testable per this plan.
- Gate: user approves test plan.

### Phase 3 — Architect Review + Schema Freeze
- Agent: `architect-reviewer` | Skills: `review-stories` + `schema-freeze`
- Validates stories and test plan; freezes schema before implementation.
- Output: report with verdict + `${architecture.paths.docs_process_root}/schemas/SCHEMA-FROZEN-{ticket}.md`
- Gate: all BLOCKERs resolved + schema frozen.

### Phase 4 — Implementation

Two sub-phases that can run in parallel if stories are independent (when
`workflow.parallel_implementation: true`):

- **4a Backend** — Agent: `backend-developer` | Skill: `implement-story`
  - Order: defined by the stack profile for `${stack.backend.framework}`.
  - Check after each file: `${stack.backend.lint_cmd}`
  - Check after each story: `${stack.backend.test_cmd}`

- **4b Frontend** — Agent: `frontend-developer` | Skill: `implement-story`
  - Order: defined by the stack profile for `${stack.frontend.framework}`.
  - Check after each file: `${stack.frontend.lint_cmd}` + `${stack.frontend.typecheck_cmd}`
  - Check after each story: `${stack.frontend.test_cmd}`

Shared rules: `conventions.max_file_loc` and `conventions.max_function_loc`
respected; no hardcoded values; no magic strings (per
`conventions.enums_for_states`); all imports at file top; no commented-out code.

Gate 4: all stories implemented + checks green.

### Phase 5 — Code Review
- Agent: `code-reviewer` | Skill: `review-implementation`
- 6D framework: correctness, security, performance, maintainability,
  readability, tests.
- Output: report with findings table by severity (BLOCKER / IMPORTANT /
  MINOR / SUGGESTION / PRAISE).
- Gate: BLOCKER and IMPORTANT resolved.

### Phase 5.5 — Security Review
- Agent: `security-reviewer` | Skill: `security-audit`
- Scope: OWASP Top 10, secret scan, tenant isolation (if multi-tenant),
  auth per endpoint, GDPR (if applicable).
- Vocabulary: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / INFO.
- Gate: no CRITICAL; HIGH explicitly accepted by the user.

### Phase 6 — Tests
- Agent: `test-engineer` (mode TEST_WRITING) | Skills: `analyze-testability`,
  `generate-unit-tests`, `generate-endpoint-tests`, `validate-coverage`.
- Writes tests per the plan from Phase 2.5, following the stack profile's
  test idioms.
- Run: `${stack.backend.test_cmd}` + `${stack.backend.lint_cmd}`.
- Gate: all tests pass.

### Phase 6.5 — E2E
- Agent: `e2e-tester` | Skill: `generate-e2e-tests`
- Scope: only the golden path of changed flows.
- Legitimate skip: pure-backend cycle with no user-facing changes.
- Gate: Playwright green.

### Phase 6.7 — Deployment Verification
- Agent: `deployment-verifier` | Skill: `verify-deployment`
- Validates: `docker-compose config`, env vars documented in
  `.env.example`, nginx (if applicable), CI runs lint+test, migrations
  apply, build smoke test.
- Gate: no BLOCKER.

### Phase 6.8 — Smoke test runtime (MANDATORY in EVERY cycle)

**Applies ALWAYS.** This phase is not optional or conditional on the
type of change. Every Kuraka cycle — regardless of integration, scope,
or mode (Normal / Lite / Retroactive) — must exercise the end-to-end
flow before declaring the cycle closed. The guiding principle is
**"green tests + approved reviews ≠ working feature"**.

**The orchestrator CANNOT invoke Phase 7 (Final Audit / RETRO)** without
having completed or explicitly justified this phase. If it tries, it
must revert and complete 6.8 first.

**Mandatory steps:**

1. **Identify the principal end-to-end flow** of the change. For ANY
   change, articulate in one sentence: "the result of this cycle is
   that the system can now X when Y." If you can't articulate it, the
   scope of the cycle is poorly defined and you have to go back to
   Phase 1.
   - Examples per change type:
     - **Integration**: "incoming event → entity persisted in DB → sync
       to external service".
     - **New endpoint**: "authenticated HTTP request → validation →
       service → repository → verified response".
     - **Refactor**: "the observable behavior before and after the
       refactor is identical for the 2-3 critical flows it touches".
     - **UI / Frontend**: "the user navigates to the page, executes the
       main action, sees the expected result". Dev server + browser, not
       just a build.
     - **Schema / migration**: "the migration applies on a real (or
       snapshot) dump, the affected queries still work, the rollback is
       safe".
     - **Bug fix**: "the scenario that reproduced the bug now produces
       the correct behavior".
2. **Design ONE smoke test runtime scenario** that exercises that flow
   with:
   - Realistic input (real anonymized data or fixtures as close to
     production as possible). NOT trivial synthetic mocks generated by
     the agent.
   - Real dependencies or high-fidelity mocks (HTTP mock with verified
     responses, real DB with seeds applied, not generic `MagicMock()`).
   - Verification that ALL components fit together: data contracts,
     expected shapes, side effects, persistence, external calls, error
     handling where applicable.
3. **Execute the scenario** end-to-end, not the pieces separately.
4. **Document the result** in
   `${architecture.paths.docs_process_root}/smoke-tests/SMOKE-{ticket}.md`:
   - Exact command executed.
   - Verified output (with literal quote or screenshot if UI).
   - Components exercised (closed list).
   - Components NOT exercised and why — every component of the flow not
     exercised needs explicit justification ("stub accepted by scope of
     ticket", "requires prod credentials not available in dev", etc.).
5. **If the smoke test fails**, open a bug-fix story in Phase 4 before
   advancing to Phase 7. **Do not close the cycle with a broken
   end-to-end flow.**

**Skip request** (no automatic skip): the orchestrator may ASK the user
to skip 6.8 ONLY in these cases, and only with explicit approval:

- **Pure documentation**: the cycle doesn't modify executable code.
- **Refactor verifiable statically** with no behavioral change (rename,
  move files without touching logic, stricter typing without runtime
  change).
- **Documented technical impossibility** (e.g., requires infrastructure
  not available in dev). In this case, open a follow-up to add the
  smoke test when the infrastructure is available.

If the user approves the skip, **document it in the Phase 7 RETRO** as
an accepted risk with the textual justification.

**Gate**:
`${architecture.paths.docs_process_root}/smoke-tests/SMOKE-{ticket}.md`
exists and green, OR skip justification approved by the user and
documented in the RETRO.

**Why**: lessons such as the smoke-test invariant generalize a common
failure mode — `${stack.backend.test_cmd}` green + reviews approved +
RETRO closed does NOT guarantee the pieces work together. Without this
phase, any cycle can close with green tests and a broken feature —
the hidden cost is shifted to post-close and doesn't appear in formal
metrics.

### Phase 7 — Final Audit
- Agent: `final-auditor` | Skill: `run-audit`
- Output: `${architecture.paths.docs_process_root}/agent-retrospectives/RETRO-{REQ-name}.md`
  with:
  - Summary + timeline of rework.
  - Findings per agent + concrete prompt patches OR project-layer additions.
  - Systemic issues + improvements.
  - Token / latency telemetry.

## Orchestrator constraint (do NOT touch code directly)

The orchestrator (the Claude running Kuraka) **NEVER** creates or modifies
source files (`${architecture.paths.backend_root}`,
`${architecture.paths.frontend_root}`,
`${architecture.paths.tests_root}`,
`${architecture.paths.migrations_root}`) before Phase 4. All
implementation goes through `backend-developer` or `frontend-developer`,
with no exceptions for "the change is trivial".

**Legitimate exception**: the orchestrator may edit `docs/` (REQ,
stories, test plans, retros) and Kuraka system files (`.claude/skills/`,
`.claude/agents/`, `.claude/rules/`).

**Protocol if violated**:
1. Revert the change.
2. Announce the violation to the user.
3. Route through the correct agent.
4. Log the bypass in telemetry with `"agent": "orchestrator-direct"`.

This constraint was added after retros where the bypass produced type
errors and broken telemetry.

---

## General Kuraka rules

- **Never skip phases** when the pipeline includes them — every gate exists
  for a reason.
- **User approval between phases** — the orchestrator never auto-advances.
- **Schema freeze before Phase 4** — no DB changes during implementation.
- **Refresh stale stories** if the user makes corrections between phases.
- **One story at a time in Phase 4** — baby steps.
- **Token optimization**: apply `rules/17-kuraka-token-optimizations.md`
  (context digest, end-only typecheck, combined phases, mapping-table
  stories, no auto-verify).
- **Green tests ≠ working feature** (universal guiding principle): EVERY
  Kuraka cycle, regardless of change type or integration, must exercise
  the end-to-end flow before closing (see Phase 6.8).
  `${stack.backend.test_cmd}` green + approved reviews are NECESSARY but
  NEVER SUFFICIENT to declare a cycle done. If the smoke test runtime
  isn't viable, justify explicitly and record as accepted risk in the
  RETRO. **This rule applies to ANY change**: backend, frontend,
  refactor, bug fix, migration, integration, or cosmetic.
