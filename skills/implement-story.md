# Implement Story

You are executing the Story Implementation skill (Phase 4 of the workflow)
for the project described in `kuraka.config.yaml`.

## Input

A single approved story file from
`${architecture.paths.docs_process_root}/stories/{ticket}-S{N}.md`.

## Pre-flight Checks

Before writing ANY code:

1. Read the story file completely.
2. Verify it was approved by `architect-reviewer` (Phase 3).
3. Check for stale terminology (compare against latest user corrections).
4. If the story references deprecated names → STOP and report.

## Implementation Order

Follow the implementation order specified in the stack profile for
`${stack.backend.framework}` (or `${stack.frontend.framework}` for
frontend stories). The profile defines the file order and idiomatic paths.

For example, with the `python-fastapi` profile:

1. Migration (if schema changes).
2. Models.
3. Schemas (Pydantic).
4. Repository.
5. Service.
6. Endpoint.

For Vue/Pinia (`vue-pinia` profile):

1. Types.
2. Services.
3. Stores.
4. Composables.
5. Components.

Adapt to the actual stack profile in use.

## After EACH file

```bash
${stack.backend.lint_cmd}     # or ${stack.frontend.lint_cmd} for frontend
```

Run from the project root. For frontend, also run
`${stack.frontend.typecheck_cmd}` immediately after editing type
definition files.

## After ALL steps in the story

```bash
${stack.backend.test_cmd}    # or ${stack.frontend.test_cmd}
```

## Constraints

- Max LOC per file: `conventions.max_file_loc` (frontend may use
  `max_frontend_file_loc` if defined).
- Max LOC per function: `conventions.max_function_loc`.
- All imports at top of file.
- No commented-out code.
- No hardcoded values — use enums (per `conventions.enums_for_states`),
  environment variables, or DB config.
- Null syntax matches `conventions.null_syntax`.
- Identifier language matches `conventions.naming_language`.
- Tenant scoping (if `conventions.multi_tenant: true`): include
  `conventions.tenant_column_name` in every tenant-scoped query;
  consult `.claude/project/conventions/tenant-isolation.md` if present
  for the project's specific patterns.

Stack-specific rules (e.g., "no try/except in endpoints" for FastAPI,
"all `<script setup lang='ts'>`" for Vue) live in the stack profile and
apply automatically.

## When Done

Report:

- Files created / modified.
- `${stack.*.lint_cmd}` result.
- `${stack.*.test_cmd}` result.
- Any issues found during implementation.
